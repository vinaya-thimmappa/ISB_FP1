# Stock Price Prediction with Regression Model

This repository contains a machine learning project for predicting stock prices using a regression model. The project includes a Streamlit application for a user-friendly frontend interface.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to use historical stock price data to predict future prices by applying regression analysis. The machine learning model is trained on features like historical prices, volume, and possibly other financial indicators.
We have  used selenium for all scrapping and also headless chrome. This helps to get the data from new site and do  sentiment analysis on top it 

## Features

- Data processing and analysis using pandas.
- Implementation of a regression model for prediction.
- Interactive Streamlit frontend for visualizing predictions and historical data.
- Plotly for creating dynamic and responsive charts.

## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.6+
- Pip package manager

### Installation

1. Clone the repo
> git clone [[https://github.com/vinaya-thimmappa/ISB_FP1](https://github.com/vinaya-thimmappa/ISB_FP1) 
2. Install required packages
3. Run the Streamlit application locally:
> > streamlit run app.py

## Model

The regression model takes into account various features to predict stock prices. It can be trained on a daily, weekly, or monthly basis, and can predict next day's closing price or other future metrics.

## Frontend

The Streamlit application provides an interface for:

- Visualizing historical stock data.
- Displaying the predicted stock prices.
- Customizing the inputs for different stocks and timeframes.
- New Associated with Stock Price
